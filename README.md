<h1>Cypress Project</h1>

<p>This repository contains a Cypress project that you can run on your local machine. Follow the instructions below to clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the tests.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>You need to have Git, Node.js, and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. If you don't have them, follow these installation guides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Git: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Download and install Git from here</a>. Choose the version that matches your operating system.</li>
<li>Node.js and npm: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Download and install Node.js and npm from here</a>. Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version, which is recommended for most users. The npm will be installed along with Node.js.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<p>Follow these steps after you've installed the necessary prerequisites.</p>

<h3>1. Clone the repository</h3>

<p>Open your terminal (on Linux or MacOS) or command prompt (on Windows) and navigate to the directory where you want to download the project. Then, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/simsek0/cypress-project.git</code></pre>

<p>This command will create a new folder named cypress-project and download the project into this folder.</p>

<h3>2. Navigate into the project directory</h3>

<p>Next, change your current directory to the project directory using this command:</p>

<pre><code>cd cypress-project</code></pre>

<h3>3. Install the project dependencies</h3>

<p>Now, it's time to install the project dependencies. These are the packages that the project relies on, including Cypress itself. To install them, run:</p>

<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>

<p>This command will download all necessary dependencies into a node_modules folder in the project directory.</p>

<h3>4. Run the Cypress tests</h3>

<p>After the dependencies are installed, you're ready to start Cypress. You can run Cypress tests in headless mode (in the terminal) using:</p>

<pre><code>npm run cy:run</code></pre>

<p>Or you can use the Cypress Test Runner, which provides a more interactive interface, by running:</p>

<pre><code>npm run cy:open</code></pre>

<p>Remember, each command should be run in your terminal or command prompt. Some commands may take a while to complete, especially npm install and npm run cy:run.</p>

<p>Leave your terminal or command prompt open as long as you're working with the project. You can stop the processes by pressing Ctrl+C when you're done.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If you run into any issues, make sure your versions of Git, Node.js, and npm are up-to-date, and you have a stable internet connection. If you're still encountering problems, the issue may be with the project itself. In this case, please contact the project maintainers or check the project's GitHub issues to see if someone else has reported a similar problem.</p>
